OsmSharp.Testing.Stress
=======================

This repository contains some quick-and-dirty test project to do some stress testing. For now there are two apps:

- Android.GPS: Just a very simple app that follows the current GPS location and centers the map on it. A convenient app to test OsmSharp in the real world.
- Android.MBTiles: Another very simple app that has a big MBTiles map in it and support rotation and some cleanup code to test the Android activity lifecycle handling.
